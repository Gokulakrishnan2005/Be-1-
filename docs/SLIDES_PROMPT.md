## THE PROMPT (Copy everything below this line):

```
Create a clean, modern presentation for a mobile app called "1% Better — A Life OS". Use a dark theme with accent colors (green, grey, orange). The presentation should be 12-15 slides with minimal text per slide — use icons and short bullet points. Here are the slides:

SLIDE 1 — TITLE
Title: "1% Better"
Subtitle: "A Life OS for Deliberate Practice, Financial Awareness & Habit Stacking"
Note: Built with Flutter • 100% Local-First • No Cloud Required

SLIDE 2 — THE PROBLEM
Title: "Where does your time actually go?"
3 bullet points:
- We think we're productive, but rarely track it honestly
- Money comes and goes without a clear picture
- Good habits fade without accountability

SLIDE 3 — THE SOLUTION
Title: "One app. Three pillars."
3 columns:
- ⏱️ Time Tracking — Know where every hour goes

- ✅ Habit Stacking — Build streaks that stick

SLIDE 4 — HOME SCREEN (Timer Dashboard)

SLIDE 5 — THE THREE CATEGORIES
Title: "Growth • Maintenance • Entropy"

SLIDE 6 — GROWTH INTERROGATION

Bullets:
- When switching from a Growth timer, a popup asks: "How much was real deep work?"

Bullets:
